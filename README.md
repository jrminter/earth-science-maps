Plot ocean surface temperature

The objective is to plot the ocean surface temperature for the dates:

- 1992-08-16
- 1999-09-08
- 2004-09-05
- 2005-08-23

The data files were downloaded in NetCDF format from NASA's
[OpeNDAP](https://podaac-opendap.jpl.nasa.gov/opendap/allData/ghrsst/data/GDS2/L4/GLOB/CMC/CMC0.2deg/v2/1992/contents.html) repository.

It looks like a good start is supplied by [Hansen Johnson](https://hansenjohnson.org/post/sst-in-r/). 

An example by [Mark Payne](https://rpubs.com/markpayne/358146) is helpful.


The [processNC](https://rdrr.io/github/RS-eco/processNC/f/README.md) package may help.

[Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21280104/how-to-take-a-subset-from-a-netcdf-file-using-latitude-longitude-boundaries-in-r) has a decent example.
